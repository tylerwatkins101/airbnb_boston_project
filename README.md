# Airbnb Boston Project

### Installations

- python 3
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- xgboost

### Project Motivation
To explore Airbnb data in Boston and write a blog post helping potential Airbnb hosts to understand the factors affecting how much money they could potentially make.

### Files
Airbnb Boston Project - Notebook.ipynb - jupyter notebook containing code for the project
listing.csv - csv file containing airbnb data from Boston

### Results Summary 
In this project we saw that the property location, room type and number of bedrooms played a major role in pricing the listing. We saw that superhosts tend to make more than non-superhosts. We also saw that the same factors of guests ratings that correlate to an overall higher rating score for a property aren't necessarily the same factors that correlate to a higher price.

### Acknowledgements
StackOverflow referenced various times while working through the notebook.
